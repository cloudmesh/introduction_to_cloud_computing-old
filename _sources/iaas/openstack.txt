OpenStack on FutureSystems
======================================================================

.. highlight:: bash

.. role:: pink

.. note:: Many of us use cloudmesh directly to access the various
	  clouds. The interface cloudmesh provides is in regards to
	  starting multiple virtual machines more convenient. Please
	  try out the nova commands so you can appreciate what
	  cloudmesh offers. For more information about cloudmesh see
	  the Section :ref:`s_cloudmesh`.


.. note:: FutureSystems Portalname and Project ID
          For this example we assume you have set the shell variable
	  :pink:PORTALNAME to your FutureSystems portal username. This can
	  be done as follwows. Let us assume your portal name is
	  `albert`. Than you can set it with::

              $ export PORTALNAME=albert

	 If you execute the steps in this manual on india your india
	 login name is the portalname, thus you can do::

              $ export PORTALNAME=$USER

         We also assume that you have a project id that you set to::

              $ export PROJECTID=fg101
 
         if it is the number 101.


Login
-------

Currently FutureSystems has OpenStack Juno installed on India. To use
it you need to first log into india and prepare your Openstack
credentials::

       $ ssh $PORTALNAME@india.futuresystems.org

Setup OpenStack Environment
---------------------------

In case you like to use the shell command line tools you can load them
with ::

    $ module load openstack

Creating the novarc file
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An initial openrc file is currently created for you automatically and
can be activated wih ::

    $ source ~/.cloudmesh/clouds/india/juno/openrc.sh


In future this file will be created with the help of cloudmesh
simplifying access to multiple heterogeneous clouds on FutureSystems.

List flavors
------------

To list the flavors, please execute the following command ::

    $ nova flavor-list

Everything is fine, if you see an output similar to ::

       +----+-----------+-----------+------+-----------+------+-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
       | ID | Name      | Memory_MB | Disk | Ephemeral | Swap | VCPUs | RXTX_Factor | Is_Public | extra_specs |
       +----+-----------+-----------+------+-----------+------+-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
       | 1  | m1.tiny   | 512       | 0    | 0         |      | 1     | 1.0         | True      | {}          |
       | 2  | m1.small  | 2048      | 20   | 0         |      | 1     | 1.0         | True      | {}          |
       | 3  | m1.medium | 4096      | 40   | 0         |      | 2     | 1.0         | True      | {}          |
       | 4  | m1.large  | 8192      | 80   | 0         |      | 4     | 1.0         | True      | {}          |
       | 5  | m1.xlarge | 16384     | 160  | 0         |      | 8     | 1.0         | True      | {}          |
       +----+-----------+-----------+------+-----------+------+-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+

If not your environment may not be set up correctly. Make sure that
you follow the steps in this section and the account management
section carefully.

List images
-----------

After you got the flavor list, you can list the current set of
uploaded images with the nova image-list command::

       $ nova image-list

You will see an output similar to::

  +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+--------+--------+
  | ID                                   | Name                       | Status | Server |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+--------+--------+
  | 05a7e78f-d105-4c32-84c8-75562f61cfff | futuresystems/centos-7     | ACTIVE |        |
  | b1bab925-6eaa-4928-bced-47d7607103c8 | futuresystems/fedora-21    | ACTIVE |        |
  | c2a9788a-89f5-463d-96e5-61e144e05ba6 | futuresystems/ubuntu-12.04 | ACTIVE |        |
  | 04a6d3aa-026b-4679-bd6b-7fef8a98e4be | futuresystems/ubuntu-14.04 | ACTIVE |        |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------------------+--------+--------+
  

Key management
--------------
.. note:: Make sure to check if you have not already created a key with
	  the name  at::

	    ~/.ssh/$PORTALNAME-key

	  if so, please use another name. However, if you want to
	  reuse the key, you certainly can do that. Also make sure the
	  key is not already uploaded.  This can be easily done in the
	  following way::

	    $ nova keypait-list

To start a virtual machine you must first upload a key to the
cloud::

       $ nova keypair-add $PORTALNAME-key > ~/.ssh/$PORTALNAME-key
       $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/$PORTALNAME-key
       $ nova keypair-list
       +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
       | Name            | Fingerprint                                     |
       +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
       | $PORTALNAME-key | ab:a6:63:82:dd:08:d3:bc:c0:21:56:4c:e2:bb:22:ac |
       +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+

Make sure you are not already having the key with that name in order
to avoid overwriting it in the cloud. Thus be extra careful to execute
this step twice. Often it is the case that you already have a key in
your `~/.ssh` directory that you may want to use. For example if you use
rsa, your key will be located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. 

Managing security groups
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next step we need to make sure that the security groups allow
us to log into the VMs. To do so we create the following policies as
part of our default security policies. Not that when you are in a
group project this may already have been done for you by another group
member. We will add ICMP and port 22 on default group::

       $ nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0
       $ nova secgroup-add-rule default tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0
       $ nova secgroup-list-rules default

.. note:: Most likely you will get some errors at this time as the
	  definitions may already uploaded by default. simply ignore
	  the errors and move on.

You will see the following output if everything went correctly::

       +-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------------+
       | IP Protocol | From Port | To Port | IP Range  | Source Group |
       +-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------------+
       | icmp        | -1        | -1      | 0.0.0.0/0 |              |
       | tcp         | 22        | 22      | 0.0.0.0/0 |              |
       +-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------------+

Booting an image
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To boot an instance you will need first to identify the `$NET_ID`::

    $ NET_ID=$(nova net-list| awk '/ int-net / {print $2}')

Now you can use the command::

  $ nova boot --flavor m1.small \
            --image "futuresystems/ubuntu-14.04" \
            --nic net-id=$NET_ID \
            --key_name $PORTALNAME-key $PORTALNAME-001

	    
Please note that the last parameter is a "label" for the VM and we
recommend thst you use a unique label. If everything went correctly,
you will see an output similar to::

       +-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
       | Property                    | Value                                |

       +-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+


List running images
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To check if your instance is active you can repeatedly issue the list
command and monitor the Status field in the table::

       $ nova list

       +-------------+-----------------+--------+------------+-------------+--------------------+
       | ID          | Name            | Status | Task State | Power State | Networks           |
       +-------------+-----------------+--------+------------+-------------+--------------------+
       | c66 ... c73 | $PORTALNAME-001 | ACTIVE | -          | Running     | int-net=10.23.0.87 |
       +-------------+-----------------+--------+------------+-------------+--------------------+

Add floating IP address
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Internal IP is not reachable from external nework. So you need to add 
a floating IP address to your instance. First, create a floating IP 
address::

       $ nova floating-ip-create ext-net
       +-----------------+-----------+----------+---------+
       | Ip              | Server Id | Fixed Ip | Pool    |
       +-----------------+-----------+----------+---------+
       | 149.165.158.149 | -         | -        | ext-net |
       +-----------------+-----------+----------+---------+

And then, add the IP address to your instance::

       $ nova add-floating-ip $PORTALNAME-001 149.165.158.149

Now, you should be able to login to your instance via ssh command like this::

       $ ssh -l ubuntu -i ~/.ssh/$PORTALNAME-key 149.165.158.149

If you see a warning similar to::

       Add correct host key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
       Offending key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts:3

you need to delete the offending host key from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.

Using block storage
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can create a block storage with the volume-create command. A
volume is useful as you can store data in it and associate that
particular volumen to a VM. Hence, if you delete the VM, your volume
and the data on it is still there to be reused. To create one 1G volume
you can do ::

       $ nova volume-create 1 --display-name $PORTALNAME-vol-001

To more conveniently identify the image we also specified a
displayname. Please chose a uinque name so you can identify the volume
more easily.

To list the volumes you can use::

       $ nova volume-list
       +--------------+-----------+---------------------+------+-------------+-------------+
       | ID           | Status    | Display Name        | Size | Volume Type | Attached to |
       +--------------+-----------+---------------------+------+-------------+-------------+
       | 6d0d ... abc | available | $PORTALNAME-vol-001 |  1   | None        |             |
       +--------------+-----------+---------------------+------+-------------+-------------+

To attach the volume to your instance you can use the volume-attach
subcommand. Let us assume we like to attache it as "/dev/vdb", than
you can use the command:::

       $ nova volume-attach $PORTALNAME-001 6d0d8285-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxabc "/dev/vdb"

.. hint:: Hint

   $PORTALNAME-001 refers to the name of the VM that we have
   created earlier with the boot command.

Next, let us login to your instance, make filesystem and mount it.
Here's an example, mounting on /mnt::

       $ ssh -l ubuntu -i ~/.ssh/$PORTALNAME-key 10.35.23.18
       ubuntu@$PORTALNAME-001:~$ sudo su -
       root@$PORTALNAME-001:~# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb
       root@$PORTALNAME-001:~# mount /dev/vdb /mnt
       root@$PORTALNAME-001:~# df -h
       Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
       /dev/vda1        20G  2.1G   17G  11% /
       none            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
       udev            998M  8.0K  998M   1% /dev
       tmpfs           201M  236K  201M   1% /run
       none            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
       none           1002M     0 1002M   0% /run/shm
       none            100M     0  100M   0% /run/user
       /dev/vdb        4.8G   23M  0.8G   1% /mnt

When you want to detach it, unmount /mnt first, go back to indias's
login node and execute volume-detach::

       root@$PORTALNAME-001:~# umount /mnt
       root@$PORTALNAME-001:~# exit
       ubuntu@$PORTALNAME-001:~$ exit
       
       $ nova volume-detach $PORTALNAME-001 6d0d8285-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

Make a snapshot of an instance
------------------------------

To allow snapshots, you must use the following convention: 

* use your project number fg### in the prefix of your snapshot name followed
  by a /

* If needed you can also add your username as a prefix in addition to
  the project number. Replace the $PORTALNAME with the username of your
  FutureSystems account.

Let us assume your project is fg101 and you want to save the image
with by reminding you it was a my-ubuntu-01 image you want to
key. Than you can issue on india the following command::

       $ nova image-create $PORTALNAME-001 fg101/$PORTALNAME/my-ubuntu-01
       $ nova image-list
       +--------------+--------------------------------+--------+--------------+
       | ID           | Name                           | Status | Server       |
       +--------------+--------------------------------+--------+--------------+
       | 18c43 ... 33 | futuresystems/fedora-18           | ACTIVE |              |
       | 1a5fd ... e9 | futuresystems/ubuntu-14.04        | ACTIVE |              |
       | f4337 ... 44 | fg101/$PORTALNAME/my-ubuntu-01 | ACTIVE | c0bd ... bcc |
       +--------------+--------------------------------+--------+--------------+

If you want to download your customized image, you can do it with this::

       $ glance image-download --file "my-ubuntu-01.img" "fg101/$PORTALNAME/custom-ubuntu-01"

.. warning:: Please note that images not following this convention may
   be deleted without warning. Also ifyou do no longer need an image,
   please remove it.

Automate some initial configuration
-----------------------------------

You may want to install some packages into the image, enable root, and
add ssh authorized_keys. With the OpenStack cloud-init such steps can
be simplified.

Create a file(mycloudinit.txt) containing these lines::

       #cloud-config

       # Enable root login.
       disable_root: false

       # Install packages.
       packages:
       - apt-show-versions
       - wget
       - build-essential

       # Add some more ssh public keys.
       ssh_authorized_keys:
       - ssh-rsa AAAfkdfeiekf....fES7060rb myuser@s1
       - ssh-rsa AAAAAAkgeig78...skdfjeigi myuser@myhost

Now boot your instance with --user-data mycloudinit.txt like this::

       $ nova boot --flavor m1.small \
                   --image "futuresystems/ubuntu-14.04" \
                   --key_name $PORTALNAME-key \
                   --user-data mycloudinit.txt $PORTALNAME-002

You should be able to login to $PORTALNAME-002 as root, and the added packages are installed.

Get the latest version of Ubuntu Cloud Image and upload it to the OpenStack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: We will try to provide the latest images. E.g., currently in india openstack 
the ubuntu 14.04 image is officially available under name: futuresystems/ubuntu-14.04. So 
usually you can skip this section to simply use the one provided officially.

Several versions of Ubuntu cloud images are available at
`http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/
<http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/>`__. Choose the version you want and
download the file name with \*\*\*\*\*\*-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img. For
example, downloading Ubuntu-14.04 is done like this::

       $ wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img

If you need a different version, please adapt the link accordingly.
You can upload the image with the glance client like this::

       $ glance image-create \
              --name fg101/$PORTALNAME/myimages/ubuntu-14.04 \
              --disk-format qcow2 \
              --container-format bare \
              --file trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img

Now your new image is listed on ``nova image-list`` and will be
available when the status become "ACTIVE".

Delete your instance
--------------------

You can delete your instance with::

       $ nova delete $PORTALNAME-002

Please do not forget to also delete your 001 vm if you no longer need
it.

   

How to change your password
---------------------------

#. Sometimes, users accidentally send password to a collaborator/support
   for debugging, and then regret. When you put yourself in the
   situation by mistake, don't worry. Just use keystone client and reset
   your password with::

       $ keystone password-update

Remember, you will also need to change it in your novarc. This can be
achieved by either editing your novarc file directly, or by editing
the file ~/.futuregrid/cloudmesh.yaml and recreating your novarc file.

Things to do when you need Euca2ools or EC2 interfaces
------------------------------------------------------

Even though the nova client and protocols will provide you with more
advanced features, some users still want to access OpenStack with EC2
compatible tools. We recommend against this and recommend instead that
you use `nova`. One such tool using eucarc files is euca2tools. We
explain briefly how you can access them.

#. Create a directory for putting eucarc, and create pk.pem, cert.pem
   and cacert.pem::

       cd ~/.futuregrid/openstack_havana
       nova x509-create-cert
       nova x509-get-root-cert
       ls -la

#. Create EC2_ACCESS_KEY and EC2_SECRET_KEY::

       keystone ec2-credentials-create

#. Create the file calle `~/.futuregrid/openstack_havana/eucarc` and put your EC2_ACCESS_KEY and
   EC2_SECRET_KEY that you obtained from the previous command into
   this file::

       export NOVA_KEY_DIR=$(cd $(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}) && pwd)
       export EC2_ACCESS_KEY="Your EC2_ACCESS_KEY"
       export EC2_SECRET_KEY="Your EC2_SECRET_KEY"
       export EC2_URL="http://i57r.idp.iu.futuregrid.org:8773/services/Cloud"
       export S3_URL="http://i57r.idp.iu.futuregrid.org:3333"

Horizon GUI
---------------------------

Horizon is a graphical user interface/dashbooard for OpenStack. For
starting up VMs and stoping them by hand horizon may be a good
mechanism to manage your Virtual machines.  We have currently the
following horizon deployments available. However, please note that on
Alamo an older version of Openstack is run.
