^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This series of screencasts will walk you through the various ways on
how you can use batch jobs on FutureSystems. This includes the following:

* using OpenMPI batch jobs including 
  * start, stop a job
  * monitoring a job
* using Hadoop as part of a batch job
* using ssh add and ssh-agent to conveniently log into machines.
