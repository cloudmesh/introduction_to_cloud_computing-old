IaaS Related projects
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There may be a possibility fo ryou to focus just on IaaS if desired
while picking one or more projects from the list bellow. Note that
each project is supposed to develop a cloudmesh_ module also. Thus you
can ot just pick one from bellow with the exception of the ironic
project.

For the following projects please contact Gregor von Laszewski

* cloudmesh_cluster across azure, openstack, aws (currently we only have within one machine) 

* cloudmesh_pbs 
* cloudmesh_slurm
* cloudmesh_pig
* cloudmesh_zookeeker
* cloudmesh_hbase
* cloudmesh_apache
* cloudmesh_drupal
* cloudmesh_web for cloudmesh_pbs Web interface to cloudmesh_pbs
* cloudmesh_web for launcher integration 
* cloudmesh_bare metal with openstack ironic (probably too difficult
  as we have not deployed ironic, maybe student can do this on their
  own infrastructure)
