Spatial Big data/Spatial Statistics/Geographic Information Systems
===============================================================================

Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big data is defined as high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety information
assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing
for enhanced insight and decision-making. Geospatial data certainly fits the
definition of big data.

Now that Big Data Tools Analytics have been developed. The same tools can be
applied to geospatial data and it will allow users to analyze massive volumes
of geospatial data.   Petabyte of remotely sensed geospatial data are capture
yearly and been store in different databases. Increasingly, however, the size,
variety, and update rate of datasets exceed the capacity of commonly used
spatial computing and spatial database technologies to learn, manage, and
process the data with reasonable effort. We believe that developing and
harnessing Spatial Big Data represents the next group of GIS services. Also, to
create a smart city requires the collection of real-time geospatial data and
other sensor data and then to exploit the necessary information and apply it
effectively.


Some tools that needed for Spatial Big Data are: indexing, retrieval, routing,
spatial statistics, and big data analysis, and visualization.

Dataset
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uber Ride Sharing GPS Data (GPS data is publically available on infochimps.com) 

Algorithm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will be analyzing a public available GPS dataset from a popular ride
sharing service Uber. We try to answer the following questions:

1) Does the usage of the ride sharing service change over time?
2) Where do most people go during the weekends?
3) Where do most people go during the weekdays?
4) Visualizing the traffic patterns with D3 and Tableau visualization software

Possible Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Big Data:
 Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark, GIS-tools, Apache Mahout, MLlib -Machine
 Learning Library for Apache Spark's

* Development: Java, Python, Scala
* Visualization: D3 Visualization, Tableau visualization, etc.
