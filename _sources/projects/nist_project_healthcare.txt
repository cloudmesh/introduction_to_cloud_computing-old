Big data Analytics for Healthcare Data/Health informatics
===============================================================================

Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big data is defined as high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety information
assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing
for enhanced insight and decision-making. Healthcare data certainly fits the
definition of big data.

Large amount healthcare data is produced continually and store in different
databases. With the wide adoption of electronic health records that has
increased the amount of data available exponentially. Nevertheless, the
healthcare providers has been slow to leverage the vast amount of data to
improve heath care system or use data to improve efficiency to reduce overall
cost of healthcare.

Health care data has the potential to innovate the procedure of health care
delivery in the US and inform healthcare providers about the most efficient and
effective treatments. Value-based healthcare programs will provide incentives
to both healthcare providers and insurers to explore new ways to leverage
healthcare data to measure the quality and efficiency of care.

Healthcare use
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is estimated that in the US healthcare spending approximately, $75B to $265B
is lost each year to healthcare fraud. [1]

works and what it means for providers. J AHIMA. 2011;82(9): 46–47.

With the amount of healthcare fraud, the importance of identifying fraud and
abuse in healthcare cannot be ignored; so healthcare providers must develop
automated systems to identify fraud, waste and abuse to reduce its harmful
impact on their business.

Algorithms
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Develop statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning
tools to statistically analyze and develop predictive models for healthcare
payment data and possibly detect irregularities and prevent healthcare payment
fraud.

Dataset
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Healthcare dataset:  Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
(http://www.cms.gov), released in the dataset into the public domain known as
“Medicare Part-B in 2014”. The dataset includes a set of records documenting
about transactions between over 900,000 medical providers and CMS.

Possible Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Big Data:
  Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark, Apache HBase, Apache Mahout, apache
  Lucene/Solr, MLlib -Machine Learning Library for Apache Spark's

* Visualization: D3 Visualization, Tableau visualization.

* Development: Java, Python, Scala and JavaScript, JQuery
