A Survey of DevOps Frameworks in support of Big Data
======================================================================

Motivation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

DevOps frameworks have recently changed the way many coorporations and
reserach projects conduct deployments and softwaredevelopment.

Task
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project wuou will be providing a {\bf extensive} and {\em high
quality scholarly survey and review of various DevOps frameworks.
This project will be conducted in co-authorship with Gregor von
Laszewski. The document will be using Word. References must be
maintained in endnote or Mendeley. If possible Microsoft Live will be
used to share the document. Alternatively the paper can be written in
LaTeX.

THis project is not an easy project as we expect more than just a
summary, but an evaluation or guidance section that identifies
advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches. It may be
necessary to test some of the systems out. This may include hosting
companies that offer DevOps support services.

Details will be discussed in our meetings in this project. Multiple
students can participate in the project, but responsibilities will be
clearly identified.

The authors will not plagearuise. There will be a kick of meeting with
the students that select this project. We anticipate the maximum
number of students will be three. If more students sign up we may
identify a or additional topics to write an additional paper.

Example of possible useful Technologies for this Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Any DevOps framework
* Any PaaS using DevOps
* Supporting services such as code reporsitories

Links
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* IEEE templates: https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html

* Endnote:

As you are a student at IU I assume you qualify for the iuware version
of endnote for the duration of your course on your private PC.

* Microsoft Live: https://login.live.com
  
Artifacts
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scholarly paper
* Report written in IEEE format in LaTeX or Word
* Original images used in the report 

* To make citation of scholarly work easier we not only recommend but
  require that you use a bibliography management tool such as endnote,
  Mandaley for word or bibtex for LaTex. In case of MS Word, if you do
  not have access to endnote, please use the build in citation manager
  from Word. In case of bibtex, you can also use jabref.
  

Optional Artifacts
