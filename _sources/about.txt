About
======================================================================

The purpose of this documentation is to provide developers and students
with a very simple guide on how to get started to program in the
cloud. The documentation is available in a variety of formats
including:

* `PDF <myCloudmesh.pdf>`_
* `epub <myCloudmesh.epub>`_
* `Web pages </>`_

The material is based on practical experience that we gained
form interacting with undergraduate students starting from the
freshman level to graduate students working on a PhD. Naturally, this
means that some material may seem to you very simple and at other
times we find that some material may be missing or may have changed
over time.

It is a pleasure if you can improve this material and potentially
contribute your own section to it. You can coordinate your
contribution by contacting Gregor von Laszewski (laszewski@gmail.com).

Independent Study at IU
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gregor is also an Adjunct Associate Professor at Indiana University
in the Computer Science Department and thus can supervise students to
take independent studies. Independent studies provide an excellent
opportunity to engage more intensely in projects related to cloud
computing. Independent studies may not just include cloud computing
activities but can also be done on other topics related to computer
science. You can als propose your own topic and we can discuss if it
is suitable. Almost all programming is done in Python, and Javascript.
We accept a suitable small number of projects in Java if necessary as
part of the topic. The topics are not listed by priority. One or more
topic may be covered in the independent study. We will discuss this in
a meeting. The amount of work for a 3 hour independent study is the
same for a very demanding class in the departments. Expect 15-20 hours
of work per week. Those with significant programming experience will
have an easier time.

Cloud Topics 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Develop a cloud portal in django replicate significant functionality
  of our flask portal)

  - must use bootstrap
  - must use jinja2 in addition to djangos rendering engine
  - must interface with our mongodb (not needed for authentication)
  - must provide a user mashup between the user database from django
    and our own user database (containing contact information)

* Develop a user management system
* Improve the CLoudmesh Portal with Javascript
* Manage 10000 virtual machines
* Develop a PaaS launcher
* Develop an HPC interface
* Develop improvements to the cloud shell

Data Topics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Develop a program that solves name ambiguity in bibliographic data by
  investigating a social network graph
* Develop a scalable distributed mongo db for our publication data,
  conduct performance comparisons for searches

Student Employment at IU
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An independent study is also a precursor to gaining employment as a
student with him at Indiana University with us. Students without
significant programming experience will not be considered. Preference
is given to those that have strong background in python and
Javascript. If you do not have such knowledge, we expect that you gain
it as part of your independent study. In some cases exceptions are
made, this may include students that have programmed significantly in
other projects.

Employment is mostly done on an hourly rate. During the time of
employment we also recommend that students take an independent study
with Gregor. IN some cases this is mandatory to be considered. Thus
plan your independent studies carefully.
