OpenStack Web Dashboard (Horizon)
===============================================================================

On FutureSystems, we have a web interface for OpenStack cloud management,
OpenStack Horizon. It supports most functionality that you can use to manage
cloud resources via commannd line tools such as Nova Compute CLI with graphical
illustration.

Overview
