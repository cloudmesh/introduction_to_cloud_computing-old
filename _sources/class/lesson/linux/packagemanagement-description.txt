Package Manager: is a tool to install, update or remove software on
the system. A pre-defined set of files also called a package will be
used to setup software. It also manages dependencies such as a certain
library or an other required program to be installed. If program A
requires program B and library C, installing B and C should be done
prior to program. The package manager easily handles packages which
are compiled sets of software. With different types of Linux
distributions, there are several package managers i.e. yum, apt-get or
brew.
