Programming and scripting requires the use of a text editor, which is
different than a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Common editors
used on Linux include nano, vi, or emacs. There are many others, but
most examples will use nano and interested students can investigate vi
or emacs as they wish. The principal difference between a text editor
like nano and a word processor like MS Word is how text is saved to
disk. A text editor saves its contents as plain text ("what you type
is what you save"). A word processor supports formatting, such as
bold- or italicized-face and different fonts. A text editor is
appropriate for writing Python code, shell scripts, or
reStructuredText documents but a word processor should not be used.
