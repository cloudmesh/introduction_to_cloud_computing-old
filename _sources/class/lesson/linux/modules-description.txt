Modules (Software Environment Management): is a dynamic shell
management tool. Environment variable settings can be loaded, unloaded
or switched on the fly while users are using the shell. Working on
different versions of software is possible using the Module package
while it manages environment variables i.e. PATH, MANPATH, etc by
reading modulefiles.
