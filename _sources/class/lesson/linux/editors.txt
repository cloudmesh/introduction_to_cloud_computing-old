Editing Files (Under Preparation)
======================================================================


..

       When we say, "``nano`` is a text editor," we really do mean
       "text": it can only work with plain character data, not tables,
       images, or any other human-friendly media. We use it in examples
       because almost anyone can drive it anywhere without training, but
       please use something more powerful for real work. On Unix systems
       (such as Linux and Mac OS X), many programmers use `Emacs
       <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`__ or `Vim
       <http://www.vim.org/>`__ (both of which are completely
       unintuitive, even by Unix standards), or a graphical editor such
       as `Gedit <http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/>`__. On Windows, you
       may wish to use `Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`__.

       No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it
       searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it
       will (probably) use your current working directory as its default
       location. If you use your computer's start menu, it may want to
       save files in your desktop or documents directory instead. You can
       change this by navigating to another directory the first time you
       "Save As..."
