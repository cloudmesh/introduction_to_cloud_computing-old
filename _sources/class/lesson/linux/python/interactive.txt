Start by entring the interactive loop by executing the command::

  $ python

You should see something like the following::

  Python 2.7 (r27:82500, Aug 10 2010, 11:35:15) 
  [GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>>

The ``>>>`` is the prompt for the interpreter.
This is similar to the shell interpreter you have been using.


.. tip::

   Often we show the prompt when illustrating an example. This is to
   provide some context for what we are doing. If you are following
   along you will not need to type in the prompt.


This interactive prompt does the following:

- *read* your input commands
- *evaluate* your command
- *print* the result of evaluation
- *loop* back to the beginning.

This is why you may see the interactive loop referred to as a
**REPL**: **R**\ead-**E**\valuate-**P**\rint-**L**\oop.
