Start by entring the interactive loop by executing the command::

  $ python

You should see something like the following::

  Python 2.7 (r27:82500, Aug 10 2010, 11:35:15) 
  [GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>>

The ``>>>`` is the prompt for the interpreter.
This is similar to the shell interpreter you have been using.
