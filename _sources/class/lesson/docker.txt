Try Docker Basic on FutureSystems
===============================================================

Docker is an image-based resource isolation software by using operating system
level virtualization.  Docker host runs software containers which deploy
applications with its environments. You can easily share your application using
Docker container across different platforms or operating systems.  This
section, we introduce basic commands of ``docker`` to introduce Docker software
on FutureSystems.  In the next section, we will explore advanced use of
``docker`` on FutureSystems.

Tutorial: Docker Basic commands
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. tip:: approximate time 30 minutes

In this tutorial, we are going to learn basic commands of Docker software.
Keep in mind that ``docker`` is a main program and ``container`` is an image
that you would like to use. You may have several containers in your docker.

Install Docker 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use Ubuntu package tool `apt-get` to download and install Docker.

::

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install docker.io

.. tip:: To get the latest version, try this:
    curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ubuntu/ | sudo sh

..  sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 36A1D7869245C8950F966E92D8576A8BA88D21E9
    sudo sh -c "echo deb https://get.docker.com/ubuntu docker main\
    > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list"
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install lxc-docker

Test Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~

Run a simple command "Hello, World".

::

  sudo docker run -it ubuntu echo "Hello, World"

Obtain Shell Prompt in Docker Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Docker command has a sub-command ``run`` to execute containers with a few
parameters.  In this example, we use Ubuntu 14.04 image to get bash shell
prompt.

::

  sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash


Expected result looks like this:

::
  
  root@8110bb395822:/#

Type ``exit`` to quit the shell and return to Docker host.

Run Apache Tomcat Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's easy to deploy Apache Tomcat using Docker. Please run the following
command: (sudo is supressed)

:: 

  docker run -d -p 80:8080 tomcat:8.0

It downloads tomcat image from Docker Hub and connects 80 port to 8080 port.
So, if you open a web browser ``http://localhost`` or ``http://ip address of
host`` your connection forwards to the container 8080 port. ``-d`` option
daemonizes the container.

.. tip:: Did you see ``Unable to find image 'tomcat:8.0' locally``?
         Your Docker will find ``tomcat`` from Docker Hub and download it to
         your local.


List Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use ``ps`` sub command to list available containers.

::

  docker ps

Expected result looks like this::

  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
  4690a7973fef        tomcat:8.0                   "catalina.sh run"   8 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:8888->8080/tcp   adoring_lalande

See Logs
~~~~~~~~

You can find out details of your container by looking at log messages. Use
``NAMES`` from previous command.  This example we use ``adoring_lalande`` for
your tomcat:8.0 container.

::

   docker logs -f adoring_lalande

Logs look like::

  13-Feb-2015 03:02:57.524 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.VersionLoggerListener.log Server version:        Apache Tomcat/8.0.18
  13-Feb-2015 03:02:57.526 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.VersionLoggerListener.log Server built:          Jan 23 2015 11:56:07 UTC

  ...

Search Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are looking for other containers, ``search`` command is useful to find.

For example, try to find ``ipython`` containers.

::

  docker search ipython
  
Expected result looks like this::

        NAME                                DESCRIPTION                                     STARS     OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED
        ipython/scipyserver                 IPython notebook server with the full SciP...   36                   [OK]
        ipython/notebook                    The most recent version of IPython, config...   35                   [OK]
        ipython/scipystack                                                                  10                   [OK]
        ...

.. tip:: ``STARS`` indicates popular containers.

Stop and Delete Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like stopping and terminating a virtual instance, docker stops and deletes its
container with two commands: ``stop`` and ``rm`` We use ``NAMES`` from ``docker
ps`` command. This example we use ``adoring_lalande`` for your tomcat:8.0
container.

::
  
  docker stop adoring_lalande

After stopping the container, you can delete it.

::

  docker rm adoring_lalande

Review Docker Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have learned some Docker commands. These are basic commands for Docker
software.

* ``docker run``: runs a container. ``-it`` option allows you an interactive
  mode. ``-d`` option daemonizes your container.
* ``docker logs``: displays log messages.
* ``docker ps``: shows available containers.
* ``docker search``: searches containers from Docker Hub.
* ``docker stop``: stops your container.
* ``docker rm``: deletes your container image.
