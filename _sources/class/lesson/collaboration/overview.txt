Overview and Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaboration is an important part of this course.

In order to facilitate remote assistance and homework submissions
three types of technologies:

- conferencing calls
- account/machine access
- version control

Conferencing calls will be used to talk with instructors when
difficulties arise during homework and excercises.  Google Hangouts
will be used for this.

Sometimes can best be solved when the instructor watches the steps the
student takes to solve a problem.
Here we can use the Google Remote Desktop application as well as
providing shell access to the student's FutureSystems account.

Finally, homework submissions will be done using Git and GitHub.
This allows students to collaborate on certain assignments and
shows instructors exactly what contributions each student is making.
