Overview and Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaboration is an important part of this course.

In order to facilitate remote assistance and homework submissions we
will use three types of technologies:

- conference calls
- access to FutureSystems account or personal machine machine
- version control

Conference calls will be used to talk with instructors when
difficulties arise during homework and exercises and we will use
Google Hangouts.

Sometimes issues can best be solved when the instructor watches the
steps the student takes to solve a problem.  We will use the
Google Remote Desktop application as well as providing shell access to
the student's FutureSystems account.

Finally, homework submissions will be done using Git and GitHub.
This allows students to collaborate on certain assignments and
shows instructors exactly what contributions each student is making.
