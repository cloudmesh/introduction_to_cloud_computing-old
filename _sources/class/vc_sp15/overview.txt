   Tutorial 3: Deploying MongoDB Shard Cluster <mongodb_cluster>

To build one of these clusters on FutureSystems, Cloudmesh uses OpenStack Heat
and Chef recipes. Interactive shell, Cloudmesh, provides a powerful interface
to manage, create or delete virtual machines on FutureSystems.

Examples and exercises on this documentation help you create and use virtual
machines on FutureSystems including establishing these clusters.
