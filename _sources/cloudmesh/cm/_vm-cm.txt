First let us set the error reporting to a minimal. If you like to see
more output you can switch it on by setting different debug and
loglevels.

Preparation
-----------

.. code:: python

    cm debug off
.. code:: python

    cm loglevel error
Lets get the username

.. code:: python

    cm user id
Help
----

Let us review the available commands

.. code:: python

    cm help
Activating Clouds
-----------------

In order for cloudmesh to work with multiple clouds, we need to find out
first which clouds are available. Users can add their own clouds later
which we describe in the registration section.

Let us inspect which clouds are available by invoking the list command.

.. code:: python

    cm cloud list
As you see we have a number of clouds, but none of them is already
active. Thus we need to first activate a cloud. We assume that you have
an account on FutureGrid. Let us activate the cloud india

.. code:: python

    cm cloud on india
We also have a conveniet interactive command to select a cloud to work
with, that however does not work with ipython

::

    "cloud select"

or you may also input "cloud select india" to select a specific cloud
india.

To check if the cloud was activated, simply use the list command again.

.. code:: python

    cm cloud list
Start a VM
----------

Now let us see how to start a VM on a cloud, here is how to start a VM
on cloud india.

.. code:: python

    cm "vm start --cloud=india --image=futuregrid/ubuntu-14.04 --flavor=m1.small"
Set a default flavor or image
-----------------------------

Each cloud must have a default image and a default flavor to launch vm
instances in a simple step. The ``cloud set`` command provides a way to
set default values for an image or a flavor.

.. code:: python

    cm "cloud set flavor india --flavor=m1.small"
.. code:: python

    cm "cloud set image india --image=futuregrid/ubuntu-14.04"
Get Flavors or Images
---------------------

Available flavors can be listed with the following command.

.. code:: python

    cm "list flavor india"
refresh option updates the data from the IaaS cloud. The cached data in
the mongo database will be updated.

.. code:: python

    cm "list flavor india --refresh"
The ``list image`` command provides an available vm images on a selected
cloud.

.. code:: python

    cm "list image india --column=name,updated"
Quick Start a VM
----------------

The ``vm start`` command provides a quick launch of a vm instance in
cloudmesh.

We use ``vmname`` to delete the vm instance later in this tutorial.

.. code:: python

    _vmname=!cm "label --raw"
    vmname=_vmname[0]
.. code:: python

    cm "vm start --name={vmname} --cloud=india"
Delete a VM
-----------

If you know the id or name of the virtual machine that you want to
destroy, *delete* command in cloudmesh simply terminate the instance.

.. code:: python

    cm "vm delete {vmname} --cloud=india --force"
More options to launch a VM instance
------------------------------------

When you create a new VM instance, you can also choose multiple options
such as a flavor, an image associated with the instance. The
``vm start`` command accepts optional parameters as a user input of
these options. To see a brief description of the command, try
``cm "vm --help"`` in the IPython Notebook cell.

Available options are:

-  --``cloud=<CloudName>    :`` give a cloud to work on, if not given,
   selected or default cloud will be used
-  --``count=<count>        :`` give the number of servers to start
-  --``flavor=<flavorName>  :`` give the name of the flavor
-  --``flavorid=<flavorId>  :`` give the id of the flavor
-  --``group=<group>        :`` give the group name of server
-  --``image=<imgName>      :`` give the name of the image
-  --``imageid=<imgId>      :`` give the id of the image

.. code:: python

    cm "vm start --cloud=india --flavor=m1.medium --image=futuregrid/ubuntu-12.04"
Set default cloud
-----------------

If you want to make things even more convenient, you can set a default
cloud or select a cloud to work with so that you don't have to type in a
cloud everytime you need to specify a cloud, to set india as default
cloud

.. code:: python

    cm "cloud set default india"
to select a cloud

.. code:: python

    cm "cloud select india"
You can see a selected cloud as a temporarily default cloud to work
with.

For more details of using command cloud to set up a cloud

cm "cloud -h"

Refreshing VM status
--------------------

After you have started or deleted VMs, you may want to check clouds' VMs
status. To refresh cloud india's VMs information

.. code:: python

    cm "list vm india --refresh"
Starting multiple VMs
---------------------

Sometimes we want to start more than one VM at the same time, we can
choose the option --count=int where int is the number of VMs you want to
start. For example, to start 3 VMs on india

.. code:: python

    import uuid;
    temp_group_name="ipython-tutorial-cm-" + str(uuid.uuid4().get_hex().upper()[0:6])
We use the temporary group name to delete the VMs later in this
tutorial.

.. code:: python

    cm "vm start --cloud=india --count=3 --group={temp_group_name}"
Deleting VMs
------------

To delete one VM is easy, what if we want to delete 1000 VMs, we need a
more convenient way to do it. Cloudmesh shell provides several methods
to find the VMs and delete them, you may think there are two phases of
VM deletion, searching and deleting. Here are some examples:

Let's start with deleting the VMs that we started in the previous
example. We can delete them with the group name that we used.
``temp_group_name``

.. code:: python

    cm "vm delete --cloud=india --group={temp_group_name} --force"
to delete all VMs of cloud india

``cm "vm delete --cloud=india --force"``

Note here we use the option "--force", without it the shell will give
you a list of VMs to delete and ask for your confirmation.

to delete a VM by giving its name (you may always provide a cloud unless
you have specified a default cloud or have selected a cloud)

``cm "vm delete --cloud=india sample_vm --force"``

to delete a VM by group

``cm "vm delete --cloud=india --goup=testgroup --force"``

We can also narrow the search result by giving more search conditions.
For example, to delete VMs of cloud india that they are also in the
group 'testgroup' and they have the prefix name 'abc' and their indices'
range is no greater than 100

``cm "vm delete --cloud=india --goup=testgroup --prefix=sample --range=,100 --force"``

Login to a VM
-------------

To login to a VM, you need to assign a public id to the VM you started,
for example, assign a public ip to a VM named test\_1 on cloud india:

.. code:: python

    _vmname=!cm "label --raw"
    vmname=_vmname[0]
.. code:: python

    cm "vm start --cloud=india"
.. code:: python

    cm "vm ip {vmname} --cloud=india"
``cm "vm ip test_1 --cloud=india"``

Then you can login to this VM by(note here you need to provide the login
name for your VM, it varys depend on the image you use while you start
the VM, e.g. for ubuntu, you may type --ln=ubuntu):

``cm "vm login test_1 --ln=ubuntu --cloud=india"``

If you just want to run some commands and get the return on the VM, you
may add the commands at the end following '--'(e.g. ls -a)

.. code:: python

    cm "vm login {vmname} --ln=ubuntu --cloud=india -- ls -a"
For more details for command vm

``cm "vm -h"``

.. code:: python

    cm "vm delete {vmname} --cloud=india"
Stop the vm that we started for this tutorial.

Vitual Machine Name
-------------------

In Cloudmesh, the default name of VM consists of your username and a
number, for example, alex\_1. ``label`` command allows you to manage or
modify the VM name as you wish.

.. code:: python

    cm label
``cm "label --prefix=gregor --id=40"``

If the user doesnâ€™t provide a name while starting VMs, cloudmesh will
generate labels for them. The default form to name VMs is prefix\_index,
where prefix is a string and index is an non-negative integer. If a
index is used, the index value will be automatically added by one
waiting to be used for next VM. To check your current prefix and index
