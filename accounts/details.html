<p>It is very easy to obtain a project and account on
FutureSystems. However, you need to get in contact first with
FutureSystems to identify if you are allowed to use this research
environment.</p>
<p>While it is possible to just execute the three steps in our quickstart
guide, we have provided a more in-depth description based on user
feedback. You have certain responsibilities including <strong>managing
project memberships</strong> and <strong>reporting results</strong> that must be conducted
while you use FutureSystems, thus it is a good idea to read this
section carefully.  At the end of the section we also provide a
mini-FAQ of information that may be of help with respest to issues you
may have overlooked or that have not yet been answered.  Some
screencasts about this topic are available in section
<a class="reference internal" href="accounts.html#s-screencast-accounts"><em>Creating FutureSystems Accounts and Projects</em></a>.</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Portal Account:</dt>
<dd>A portal account is necessary to communicate information about
yourself to the FutureSystems team so that they can verify your
identity and that you are a community member who has a need to use
FutureSystems. Once you have a portal account approved you can apply
for a project.</dd>
<dt>Resource Account:</dt>
<dd>A portal account will not give you access to the FutureSystems
resources. You will have to go to the portal and join a project, or
create a new one.</dd>
<dt>Valid Project:</dt>
<dd>At least one project you belong to must be valid. A valid project is
one that is approved by a committee. If you are not in a valid,
active project your access to FutureSystems will be
blocked. Projects that do not report any progress will be blocked
after a while. Note that you agree to update regular results via the
portal as part of your agreement to use FutureSystems.</dd>
<dt>Project Lead:</dt>
<dd>The Project Lead submits a project and is responsible for updating
the project page and project members. There is exactly one Project
Lead.</dd>
<dt>Project Manager:</dt>
<dd>The Project Lead can assign editing and management roles to a
Project Manager. He will have the same rights in regards to
updating page content and members as the Project Lead.</dd>
<dt>Project  Member:</dt>
<dd>The Project Lead or Manager can add additional members to the
project. A member must have a portal account.</dd>
<dt>Project  Alumni:</dt>
<dd>Sometimes project members leave a project before it is
completed. Such members are no longer part of the project and
should not have access to the project. However they can still be
acknowledged to have played a role as part of the project by being
placed as a member of the alumni role.</dd>
<dt>Uploaded SSH Key:</dt>
<dd>As you are using remote compute resources, we will require that you
are very familiar with ssh key management. You will need to upload a
public ssh key to the portal so that we can create an account for
you and use that public ssh key to allow you to log in to use the
resources.</dd>

<p>If you have never created a project on FutureSystems, we recommend
that you <strong>do not use the quickstart guide</strong> and instead read the full
documentation. To remind you what you have to do here are a couple
steps that you need to do:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/user/register">Create a Portal account</a> and wait for

<p>In order to utilize <strong>any</strong> FutureSystems resource, you must possess a
FutureSystems <strong>portal account</strong>. Thus, <em>apply for your portal
account</em> before you attempt anything else. This account is used to
gather some information that we will use in the next steps. You must
make sure that the information is complete before you proceed to the
second step.  FutureSystems performs basic verification of the information
you provide when creating an account, so it may take a little while
before your account is approved. Once you have a portal account, please
proceed.</p>
<p>Please note that you cannot access FutureSystems resources until you
complete the next steps.</p>

<p>To apply for a new project, fill out the <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/node/add/fg-projects">project creation
form</a>.  Through this form we gather some
important information about the project so that we can review it for
approval. This information is used to report and document to us as
well as to our sponsors, to state which activities are conducted on
FutureSystems. The more precise you are in your descriptions and
filling out the forms the better we can highlight your project. Once a
project is approved, project members can join a project.  This must be
conducted by the project lead.</p>
<p>It is mandatory for the project lead to agree to certain reporting
requirements so as to provide information to FutureSystems. He will be
responsible to make sure that they are completed and also implemented
with the users joining the project.  Thus the user is responsible to
comply with the terms of the project in regards to reporting and
acknowledgments in case of publications. Each project Project Lead has
the responsibility to communicate such requirements to the members and
managers. The project agreements override the individuals agreement.</p>

<p>When applying for a project, you may directly visit the project
creation page and fill it out. However, you may find it useful to
prepare a separate (ASCII, or MS word) document and take advantage of
spelling and grammar checkers. Furthermore, as filling out the form
may take some time, it seems best to just copy and paste from your
document into the form. This way you may avoid issues such as power
failures or network interruptions which could cause you to lose the
information that has been entered on the form but not yet submitted.</p>
<p>Examples for a project can be found also on the portal itself
when looking at the list of projects conducted on Futuregrid:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All projects: <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects/all">https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects/all</a></li>
<li>Class Projects: <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects/keywords/course">https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects/keywords/course</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Recently we have increased the requirements for project
approval. Hence it is important that you write a couple of paragraphs
in the application.  A single sentence such as <em>I want to learn cloud
computing</em> will typically no longer be approved. Please examine a
sample class project which could be an inspiration
for your own class projects (<tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">project.txt</span></tt>):</p>

Abstract: *
=========

Note: this is an example project and is not a real project,
although the contents presented in this material is available.

This course will introduce the students at Indiana University as
part of the Summer Semester 2012 into the essentials of Cloud
Computing and HPC. We will start the course by teaching the
students python within one week. As cloud computing framework we
have chosen OpenStack, as it has become one of the ubiquitous IaaS
frameworks and is available on FutureSystems. Additionally, we will
teach the students how to program a simple MPI application so that
they can further develop the virtual cluster code available from
github (https://github.com/futuregrid/virtual-cluster).  We will
compare the performance between the virtualized and non virtualized
environment as develop with the help of our cloud metrics system a
scheduler that enables us to use bare metal provisioned clusters
and virtualized clusters on-demand based on resource requirements
and specifications. We are aware that the FutureSystems team is
developing such an environment, and would like to join the efforts
throughout our course with the contributions conducted by the
students.

Course Dates:

This class will be taught in 10 weeks as part of the Indiana
University CS curriculum. The following dates are important

      Start: July 13, 2013
      End:   Sept 23, 2013
      Extension: 1 month for students with programming in-completes.

   1. Introduction and Overview
   2. Essential Python for the Cloud
   3. Introduction to OpenStack
   4. Programming OpenStack
   5. Programming a HPC Cluster
   6. Creating a Virtual Cluster
   7. Performance Comparison
   8. Cloud Metrics
   9. Cloudmesh
   10. Joining FutureSystems Software Developments

Grading Policies:
   Class participation and contribution: 5%
   Homework assignments, reading summary, and paper presentation: 50%
      Programming assignments: (30%)
      Reading Summaries: (10%)
      Paper Presentation: (10%)

      Proposal: (10%)
      Midterm Presentation: (10%)
      Final Presentation and Demo: (15%)
      Final Report: (15%)

   Note:
     Homework and programming assignments are due by 11:59pm
     Thursdays (unless announced in class otherwise). Late homework
     (non-programming) will NOT be accepted. Late program penalty
     is 10% per day, according to the timestamp of your online
     submission. Only when verifiable extenuating circumstances can
     be demonstrated will extended assignment due dates be
     considered. Verifiable extenuating circumstances must be
     reasons beyond control of the students, such as illness or
     accidental injury. Poor performance in class is not an
     extenuating circumstance. Inform your instructor of the
     verifiable extenuating circumstances in advance or as soon as
     possible. In such situations, the date and nature of the
     extended due dates for the assignments will be decided by the
     instructor.

 Please note that FutureSystems does not approve accounts on the
 weekends. Regular support hours are Mo-Fri 9am - 5pm. Please
 note that answering support questions does take time. Do not
 start the night before the homework is due. Plan your
 programming assignments to be done early.

Intellectual Merit: *
===================

The course will be introducing the students to cloud computing and
will also be used to derive new class materiel that we will be
using in subsequent lessons.

Broader Impact: *
===============

This class will be educating a number of students in cloud
computing programming. Cloud computing is an important factor in
job availability after graduation of students, thus this course
will be useful to increase marketability of the students. In
addition we have in the past also been able to increase
participation of minority students. In the past we had 10 minority
students and 9 female students taking this class. We intend to work
together with Gregor von Laszewski and improve the FutureSystems
manual and to make our course material available via FutureSystems
through its github and community portal pages.

Scale of use: *
=============

We anticipate the course will have 30-35 students. The course
will be using OpenStack and HPC compute resources and requires for
selected students access to bare metal provisioning.  The course
will not require to run computationally intense
applications. However, we require that students be able to run up
to 30 VMs at a time. We know that this may in peak hours be beyond
the capabilities of FutureSystems and are advising our students to
kill machines if they are not used. The maximum duration of a
single VM will typically be less than 5 minutes.

<p>To join an existing project, ask the project lead or project manager
for that project to add you to their project using your portal account
name.  However for most projects there is an easier way if the project
is set to &#8220;accept public join request&#8221;, you may also send a request in
the portal. To do this, first view the <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects">project list</a> and go to the project detail page by clicking the project
title. If the project is set by the project lead to &#8220;accept join
request&#8221;, then you&#8217;ll see a large gray &#8216;Join this project&#8217; button in
the upper right corner of the page. Click the button to send the join
request to the project lead and manager so that they can process your
request:</p>

<p>Deletion of a user can be a complex process if a user has used FG
resources. However, the following is for most project leads
sufficient: To remove a user from your project you simply can edit
your project page and remove the user name from the list of members or
alumni. If the user is in no other valid project she will no longer be
able to use FG.  If the user really needs to be removed from the
system or from the portal, please fill out the <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/help">help form</a> with the username and the
reason why he should be removed.  Naturally, if you detect that a user

<p>In order to be able to log into the started VMs, among other purposes,
you need to provide FG with a secure-shell (ssh) public key. If you are
already a frequent user of ssh, and have a private and public key pair,
it is perfectly reasonable to provide your public key. It&#8217;s <em>public</em>,
after all.</p>
<p>To upload the chosen public key:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Copy your public identity into your system clipboard.</li>
<li>Visit the <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/my/ssh-keys">ssh-key panel of your account</a>.</li>
<li>Click the link that says Add a public key.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are not familiar with ssh keys we have provided a more
elaborate section about <a class="reference internal" href="ssh.html#s-using-ssh"><em>Using SSH Keys</em></a></p>
<p>Changes to keys will take up to 1 hour to propagate through the system
services. You are not allowed to use password less keys.  Your account

<p>To access and use resources, you must</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>have a portal account</li>
<li>be part of a valid project</li>
<li>have uploaded a public key to the portal that you will use to log
into some of its resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these conditions are met, you will be able to access the
resources and services that your project has requested and been
authorized to use. See the section <em class="xref std std-ref">s-services</em> for a list of
FutureSystems resources and services. This includes cloud and HPC
resources. Accounts to these resources will be automatically generated
once you have conducted the above steps. The turnaround time for you
getting access to the system is typically between 30 minutes and one
day.</p>

<p>If you teach a class using FutureSystems resources we recommend you do
the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Create a portal account if you do not have one.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Apply for an educational project, carefully filling out the form
including how many students, broader impact, such
as support of minorities, what will be learned, the course syllabus
if available, a link to the course web page if available, the
duration of the course including a time when the course is
completed. We typically add a month so that incomplete projects can be
completed easily.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make sure you enable the join button of the project, this will
allow your students to join via a button click and you can easily
approve or reject join requests. Come up with a &#8220;signup code&#8221; to be
shared with the students.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Give your students the signup code that you have chosen
in the previous step. Communicate the signup code to the FutureSystems
support team via a ticket submitted through
<a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/help">https://portal.futuregrid.org/help</a>. Make sure you specify your
project number. Often it is also helpful to send a list of students
to us so that, it is easier for us to assist them during the application
process.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make sure your students sign up for a FutureSystems portal account and
that they specify their profile information precisely. This
information is used later on to grant students accounts on
FutureSystems. Accounts will not automatically be created just because a
user has a portal account. Have the students add you as their advisor
in the advisor textarea.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Remind the students to add their public ssh-keys to the
portal. Some students may not have the knowledge what this means or
what this is good for. We recommend that you in the first class
teach the why they need to do this and how the can do this. In the
portal users can add ssh keys when they go to the my portal
section.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It will take some time for the accounts to be created after
an ssh key is uploaded, and the student is added to your approved
projects.  Communicate to the students to wait. We only approve
accounts during business hours and it can take up to 24 business
hours. Business hours are Mo-Fri 9am - 5pm EST. We will not answer
any questions on the weekends.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Once a student has an account on the portal, please make sure you
add the student to your project. This is important as only people
that are assigned to a valid FutureSystems project can have accounts
on FutureSystems resources. Your project will by default have a
project join request, which makes it easier for students to join your
project. Provide the link to the students so that they can join. A
convenient management button is provided where you can verify that the
student is indeed a person that is to be part of your project. The
join button can be disabled by you and you could instead add
your students while entering their portal names.</p>
<p>Hence, you will be able to manage the joining of students yourself. Be
careful that you only join those students that are in your
class. Please remember that a signup code is not really secret and
that students may exchange the code with others. Thus it is a good
idea to still verify if the user with the signup code is a member
of your class. Also be reminded that some students forget
to specify the signup code at time of their account creation. You
have to deal with such forgetful students as a signup code cannot
be added.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If the student roster is changing, just edit the project details
and add/remove them or move them to the alumni status.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If student projects are due on Mondays remind them not to start
their project on Sunday night incase they find out they do not have an
account. Generally we recommend to make due dates of projects to
be Thursdays till 5pm or Friday mornings. Be reminded that on the
first Tuesday of each month all machines will be shut down and all
unsaved running VMs or ongoing work may be lost. Please plan around this.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">We have created some forums for the three services that you can
find at <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/forum">https://portal.futuregrid.org/forum</a>. These forums are read
by the experts and the staff. We can create a forum for your class
if you like directly on the FutureSystems portal.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In case you need more direct support, do not hesitate to ask for
help <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/help">https://portal.futuregrid.org/help</a></p>
