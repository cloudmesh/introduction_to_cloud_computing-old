In order to use Python you must log into your FutureSystems account.
Then at the shell prompt execute the following command::

  $ module load python

This will make the ``python`` and ``virtualenv`` commands available to
you.

.. tip::

   The details of what the ``module load`` command does are described
   in the future lesson :doc:`modules`.
