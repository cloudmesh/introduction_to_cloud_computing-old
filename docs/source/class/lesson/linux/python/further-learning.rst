There is much more to python than what we have covered here:

- conditional expression (``if``, ``if...then``, ``if..elif...then``)
- function definition (``def``)
- class definition (``class``)
- function positional arguments and keyword arguments
- lambda expression
- iterators
- generators
- loops


.. important::

   If you are not familiar with Python already it is recommended that
   you go through one of the many many freely available tutorials
   online. As an example, `Code Academy has several lessons`_ on
   Python.
