Python is an interpreted, dynamic, high-level programming language and
is suitable for a wide range of applications.

The ideals of Python are expressed in `The Zen of Python`_, of which
several statements are:

- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Complex is better than complicated
- Readability counts

The main features of Python are:

- Use of indentation whitespace to indicate blocks
- Object orient paradigm
- Dynamic typing
- Interpreted runtime
- Garbage collected memory management
- a large standard library
- a large repository of third-party libraries

Python is used by many companies (such as Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA)
and is applied for web development, scientific computing, embedded
applications, artificial intelligence, software development, and
information security, to name a few.
