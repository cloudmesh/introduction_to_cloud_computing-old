Apache Hadoop YARN
===============================================================================

YARN is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management to
support Hadoop 2 with generic applications. Upgraded Hadoop is not just simply
tied with a MapReduce application for data processing. It can support MPI
(mpich2-yarn), graph processing(Apache Giraph, Google Pregel) in a Hadoop YARN
cluster. 

.. tip:: Duration 1 hour

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apache Software Foundation (ASF) defines YARN as a next generation of MapReduce
or MapReduce 2.0 (MRv2). The main change of MRv2 is the resource management
from the programming model of MapReduce. The MRv2 consists of a single master
ResourceManager (RM), one slave NodeManager (NM) per cluster-node, and
ApplicationMaster (AM) per application. Under YARN, MapReduce is independent as
it behaves like a one type of available application running in a YARN
container. YARN is an abbreviation for Yet Another Resource Negotiator which
was addressed in January, 2008 from
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-279

* JobTracker from MR1 splits up two parts: RM, AM(job scheduling/monitoring).
* ResourceManager (RM) consists of Scheduler, ApplicationsManager (ASM).
* ASM is to manage each MapReduce job and terminated when the job completes. 
* JobHistoryServer records completed jobs.

Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* YARN configuration options, which go in yarn-site.xml
* MapReduce configuration options, which go in mapred-site.xml.

Benefits of changing MR1 to MR2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- by breaking up the JobTracker into a few different services, it avoids many
  of the scaling issues facing MR1. 

- Most important, it makes it possible to run frameworks other than MapReduce
  on a Hadoop cluster. For example, Impala can also run on YARN and share
  resources on a cluster with MapReduce.

ResourceManager (RM)

Scheduler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Scheduler is responsible for allocating resources to the various running
applications subject to familiar constraints of capacities, queues etc.  The
scheduler is responsible for deciding which tasks get to run where and when to
run them.  Capacity - Allocates resources to pools, with FIFO scheduling within
each pool. The CapacityScheduler supports hierarchical queues to allow for more
predictable sharing of cluster resources Fair - Allocates resources to weighted
pools, with fair sharing within each pool.  llocates resources based on arrival
time.

ApplicationsManager (ASM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second part of the Resource Manager, called the Application Manager,
receives job submissions and manages launching the Application Master. The
Application Manager handles failures of the Application Master, while the
Application Master handles failures of job containers. The Application Master
then is really an application-specific container charged with management of
containers running the actual tasks of the job.

Resource Container  memory, cpu, disk, network etc.

NodeManager (NM)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   (image source: http://hortonworks.com/blog/apache-hadoop-yarn-nodemanager/)


NodeManager (NM) is a YARN service that manages resources and deployment on a
cluster node. NM is separated from TaskTracker from MR1 and now NM is
responsible for launching containers, each of which can house a map or reduce
task.  NM is YARN’s per-node agent, and takes care of the individual compute
nodes in a Hadoop cluster. This includes keeping up-to date with the
ResourceManager (RM), overseeing containers’ life-cycle management; monitoring
resource usage (memory, CPU) of individual containers, tracking node-health,
log’s management and auxiliary services which may be exploited by different
YARN applications.

* Main task: Job life-cycle management

ApplicationMaster (AM)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ApplicationMaster (AM) is for executing shell commands on a set of launched
containers using the YARN framework. AM is started on a container by the
ResourceManager's launcher. The first thing that AM needs to do is to connect
and register itself with the ResourceManager (RM). The registration sets up
information within RM regarding what host:port AM is listening on to provide
any form of functionality to a client as well as a tracking url that a client
can use to keep track of status/job history if needed.  AM needs to send a
heartbeat to RM at regular intervals to inform RM that it is up and alive.

QnAs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Q. What if a cluster node goes down for any reason? How resources are relocated?
* A. When a node goes down, the corresponding containers including
  ApplicationMaster (AM) also get terminated. ResourceManager automatically
  restarts AM based on application policies and notifies the corresponding AMs to
  containers so that they can take further actions e.g. retry, kill application.

* Q. Is there a monitoring toolkit for resource allocation, cluster node, or
  entire cluster?
* A. There are several ways to monitor resource allocation using the client
  side RPC calls. Similar APIs exist for per node usage, cluster usage. See
  getApplicationReport(), getClusterNodes() and getClusterMetrics() APIs at
  http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/ApplicationClientProtocol.html.
