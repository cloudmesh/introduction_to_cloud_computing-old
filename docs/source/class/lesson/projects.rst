Here is one example Take data from US Census (you can use GE data on location
of light bulbs if you want!) such as
http://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2010/glance/ Injest into Hbase.  Build
an analytics toolkit e.g. clustering people location with Hadoop/Mahout or
Spark/MLlib Execute on a virtual cluster Visualize with D3.

but you can be more or less ambitious.

Project Expectation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect you to deal with one of the challenges from big data using open
source software. The main topics of your projects may cover one of these:

* parallel data processing on the cloud
* database on the cloud
* machine learning: optimization, modeling
* data mining
* visualization

*Other technology landscape can be addressed*

Project Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please upload your project proposel in a file (either txt, Adobe PDF, or MS
word). A project proposal is typically 1-2 pages long and should contain in the
description section:

* the nature of the project and its context
* the technologies used
* any proprietary issues
* specific aims you intent to complete
* and a list of intended deliverables (see also atrifacts)
