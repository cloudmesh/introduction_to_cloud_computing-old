Cloudmesh Docker Clusetr Manager
======================================================================

Motivation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Containers are enabling new virtualization technologies. It is worth while to (a) survey docker related technologies (b) develop a tool to utilize docker within cloudmesh. This will include
the development of a virtual cluster creation tool that uses docker machines on various resources.

Task
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first part of this project project you will be providing a high quality scholarly survey and review of various docker tools and technologies.  This project will be conducted in co-authorship with Gregor von Laszewski. The document will be using Word. References must be maintained in endnote or Mendeley. If possible Microsoft Live will be used to share the document. Alternatively the paper can be written in LaTeX.

The second part of this project will be to develop a cloudmesh command and management framework to deploy docker containers on other resources. We probably can use docker-machine for this, but integrate it into cloudmesh. Improtant is that the machines are integrated into a mongdb database managed within cloudmesh. A convenient program will be developed via the cmd3 command module extension.

It will be demonstarted that on this virtual docker machine a simple application can be run. The application will be determined once the first two tasks are completed. It woill include the moving of data and the execution of an application. Possibly we could invesitgate the deployment of other technologies and platform on top of this virtual cluster.

Details will be discussed in our meetings in this project. Multiple
students can participate in the project, but responsibilities will be
clearly identified.

The authors of the paper will not plagiarize. We anticipate the maximum number of students will be three. If more students sign up we may identify a or additional topics to work on an additinal features. However the projects will not duplicate each other.

Example of possible useful Technologies for this Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Docker
* docker-machine
* swarm
...
* Mesos (on top of docker?)

As you are a student at IU I assume you qualify for the iuware version
of endnote for the duration of your course on your private PC.

Artifacts
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Working program submitted into github

  * integration with cloudmesh
  * application demonstartion
    
* Scholarly paper

  * Report written in IEEE format in LaTeX or Word
  * Original images used in the report 
  * To make citation of scholarly work easier we not only recommend but
    require that you use a bibliography management tool such as
    endnote, Mendeley for word or bibtex for LaTex. In case of MS
    Word, if you do not have access to endnote, please use the build in citation
    manager from Word. In case of bibtex, you can also use jabref.


Optional Artifacts
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Samples of using the technologies identified.
