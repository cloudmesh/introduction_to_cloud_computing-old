Human and Face Detection from Video (simulated streaming data)
===============================================================================

Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detecting humans and faces in images or videos is a challenging task due the
variability of pose, appearance and lighting conditions. Also the algorithms
have to robust enough to occlusion and clutter present in the backgrounds.
Figure 1 and Figure 2, shows human and face detection examples.

Algorithms One of the most widely used methods for human detection is the HOG
(Histograms of oriented gradients) [1].  [1] Dalal, Navneet, and Bill Triggs.
"Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection." In Computer Vision and
Pattern Recognition, 2005. CVPR 2005. IEEE Computer Society Conference on, vol.
1, pp. 886-893. IEEE, 2005.

For face detection one popular method is based on Harr wavelet and SVM
classifier described in the paper [2].  [2] Viola, Paul, and Michael J. Jones.
"Robust real-time face detection." International journal of computer vision
57.2 (2004): 137-154.

We could use the OpenCV implementation of human and face detection for our
project [3].  Mahout and/or Sparkâ€™s MLlib library for machine learning
consisting of common learning algorithms could be used for classification for
human and face detection.

Datasets
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The input data will be a simulated video stream and the output will be the
bounding box for human and face detection.

This dataset was collected as part of research work on detection of upright
people in images and video. The research is described in detail in [1].

Possible Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Big Data:
  Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark, OpenCV, Apache Mahout, MLlib -Machine Learning
  Library for Apache Spark's

* Development:  
  Java, Python, Scala
